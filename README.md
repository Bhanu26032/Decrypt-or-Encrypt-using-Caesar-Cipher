                                              Text Encryption and Decryption with Tkinter
This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for text encryption and decryption. The user can input a text message and a numerical key, and the script will perform either encryption or decryption based on the chosen operation.

Features
Encryption: Encrypts the input text using a numeric key.
Decryption: Decrypts the input text using the same numeric key.
User Interface: Simple GUI using Tkinter for user interaction.
How to Use
Run the script using a Python interpreter.

bashCopy code
python Decrypt_Encrypt.py.py

Enter the text in the "Enter Text" field.
Enter a numeric key in the "Enter Key" field.
Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt it.
The result will be displayed in the "CipherText" or "PlainText" section.
Example:

Encryption

Enter Text: "Hello, World!"
Enter Key: 3
Result: "Khoor, Zruog!"

Decryption

Enter Text: "Khoor, Zruog!"
Enter Key: 3
Result: "Hello, World!"

Disclaimer
This script is a basic example for educational purposes. Keep in mind that the provided encryption method is not secure for real-world applications. For actual encryption needs, consider using established cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (usually included with Python)
